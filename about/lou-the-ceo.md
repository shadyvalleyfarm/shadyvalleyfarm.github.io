### Lou the (honorary) CEO

Lou is a beagle who has the honorary title of CEO. Lou showed up at my office door on November
1st, 2003 with a gun being held to his head.  Well not literally but I was told he was mine
if I wanted him or he'd be shot becuase at 6 months old he was too fat and wasn't good
merchandise for the breeder to sell.  At the time I really didn't need another dog in my life 
but I didn't want him to be shot. He weighed 80lbs, his belly hit the ground, his breathing
sounded like Darth Vader's and he had bad teeth.  I put him on a better food, took him for 
walks - well tried to get him to walk, brushed his teeth every day and had a few removed. It
took me years to get him down to a healthy weight but it was worth it.  He's not a hunting
beagle nor is he really good for anything other than sleeping but he is a great companion.
When I was sick a few years ago he didn't leave my side.  When I'm sitting in my chair he'll be
under it, on my feet, or trying to get up on my lap.  Some people tell me I should have let
him be shot but I found a use for him.  He would have made a great companion dog for someone
and I think that breeder misses opportunity by "disposing" of bad merchandise.

Lou's story is one of my motivations for seeking a varied customer base for our goats. I don't
want to only raise show quality goats, nor pet quality, nor milk quality.  People buy goats
for various reasons (weed eaters) and they may not want to spend the high dollar asked for
show goats.  I'm not saying I pair breedings looking for "bargain" goats, in fact I'm trying
to avoid "bargain" goats but if I end up with one of little value that doesn't mean I'll shoot
him/her.
