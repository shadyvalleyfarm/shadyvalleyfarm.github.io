## Detailed Terms

Pricing - Prices of goats are based on various factors including the dam and sire history.  Kids from first fresheners are typically priced lower than kids from experienced dams. We will never raise the price once a deposit is received, however, if we feel the kid's quality will not be up to the price we set then we may, at our option, lower the price. You will be notified if this happens. If you no longer want the kid after a price drop then you have the right to a refund or to another kid if available.

A non-refundable deposit is required to hold any goat. Once a deposit is received the goat will be marked as "Deposit Received" you will have 2 weeks from the date the goat is ready to leave(at approximately 8 weeks of age) to arrange pickup or delivery of your goat.  If you require additional time we will charge $2.50 per day to hold the goat. This is to cover the additional costs assumed when boarding your goat. If you are unable to arrange pickup/delivery of the goat within 4 weeks of the time the goat is ready to leave then the goat will be considered for sale again and your deposit is forfeited.

Full payment is due before the goat may leave our farm. If you are paying by personal check, we reserve the right to wait 10 days to verify the check clears before releasing your goat. In the event of a returned check you will be charged $30 to cover the costs charged by our bank.  We accept Cashiers Checks, Money Orders, Cash, Paypal, and personal checks.

At this time we do not ship goats. If you require a Veterinary Certificate you are responsible for the costs of this certificate and any additional tests required by your state/local laws. If you choose our local vet we will not charge you for gas/time. You are welcome to have a veterinary inspection prior to purchase, however, the cost is to be paid by you.

If we agree to sell you a goat then we will not change our minds and retain the goat. However, in the unlikely event that we feel the goat is not healthy we reserve the right to delay or refuse the sale. If this happens then you are entitled to a refund of your deposit or you may apply it towards the purchase of another goat.  

For deposits on kids, if the desired kid (gender, eye color, dam/sire) is not available you are entitled to a refund of your deposit or applying it towards another goat. Reservations are processed in order received. Once a kid is available which matches your desired traits you will be notified via email or phone. If we are unable to reach you within 48 hours we will notify the next person in line.  Example: If you are first in line for a blue eyed doeling and we are unable to reach you within 48 hours of the birth of that doeling then we will notify the next person in line of the reservation. If you were to respond after 48 hours then you will just move to the next slot.  In the event that we are unable to reach you within 30 days we will consider your deposit as forfeited and remove you from the list.

ALL SALES ARE FINAL! You are responsible for complying with all State, Federal, and local laws. If you are a first time goat owner we highly suggest that you talk to your neighbors first. It is neighborly to let them know that you may be bringing some noisy goats around.  Home Owner Associations usually have rules against livestock. Also be aware of any deed restrictions you may have on your property. In some instances there are restrictions against livestock. Please be sure to verify that you can legally own a goat where you reside.

In our experience bottle raised vs dam raised kids have no personality differences. We have several that we bottle raised when we bought them from others and we also have kids that were dam raised.  We prefer to allow the dam to raise the kids given the value added by being raised by a mother. If you prefer to pick up the kid before weening we will ask if you have other goats for the kids to be exposed to and learn from.  We will only allow kids to leave before weening if we feel it is in the best interest of the kid.

Healthcare - Goats require shelter, browse (weeds, roughage, hay), minerals, companions(can't have just one goat), and the occasional vaccine or vet visit. You are responsible for these once the goat leaves our farm. We suggest that you talk to your veterinarian prior to purchase to make sure your vet is goat trained.

We assume no liability for the goat once it leaves our farm.
