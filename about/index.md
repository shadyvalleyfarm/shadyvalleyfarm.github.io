# About Shady Valley Farm, LLC

Our farm is a small hobby farm turning commercial.  The love for goats
goes back into the 1980s but there was a long break in there with no
goats in our lives.  We restarted the hobby back in 2012 and have
recently began turning it into a commercial operation. 

We are located in Missouri outside the small town of Fredericktown. We
are on small acreage and have long term plans to get settled in on
larger land.

We intend to sell goats for breeding, dairy, and pet purposes. Over the
past year we have been expanding our own knowledge and intend on sharing
that with the internet community through a special section on this web site.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to raise happy, healthy, friendly, and overall wonderful
goats. We aim to improve all breeds we raise through thoughtful breedings and
education of ourselves and others.
