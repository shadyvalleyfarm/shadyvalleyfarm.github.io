### Visiting The Farm

We invite anyone interested in purchasing a goat from us to set up an appointment to visit. However,
we do have some rules in place for visitors.  These rules are for the health and well being of
our animals and of our visitors. 

We ask that visitors wash hands or use hand sanitizer prior to and after interacting with our animals.
Please do not take it as an insult or that we think you are unsanitary we ask everyone this
including my own mother.  We have considered purchasing covers for shoes and disposable gloves.

We welcome children to our farm, however, we do ask that you keep a close eye on your children
while they are visiting. There is water, animals, and roads nearby which may pose a danger
to everyone.  Goats like to "nibble" to get a taste of things. This nibbling may include
clothing and/or fingers.  Although we've never had a goat bite anyone sometimes the nibbling
can be intense and may be painful to some.  We also ask that you keep pets at home. They can
be a distraction to our animals and could even be chased off. If you feel it is essential to
bring your pet please discuss this with us prior to arrival.

### Electric Fence Warning

We use electric fencing and try to remember to turn it off around the areas we expect you to visit but it
remains on in other areas.  Please be alert for energized fencing and we will attempt to
warn you if you are near live fence.

### Quarantine Area

If we have goats in quarantine during your visit we ask that you do not expect to visit or
interact with those goats.  The quarantine area is away from the visitors area and is intended
to keep from accidentally spreading disease to others.
