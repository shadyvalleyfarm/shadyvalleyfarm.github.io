## Herd Health

The health of our herd is of critical importance to our farm.  We take it very seriously and
sometimes we may seem a bit extreme but our goats are not only part of our livelihood but our
own happiness. 

We tested the entire herd on October 21st, 2013 for CAE, CL, and Johne's Disease. The herd tested
**negative**. All new arrivals in the future will be tested before being introduced into the herd.
I will not take someone's word on the health of their animals. I do not mean to offend you if I
ask questions about the health of your animals and ask you to show me test results. I will not
be offended if I am asked.  [Read the blog post about the test results](/2013/10/31/Test-Results-Are-In/)

### Bio Security

All new arrivals(except kids born on the farm) are tested for CAE, CL, and Johne's disease
within 72 hours of arrival if not prior to arrival. They are placed in designated quarantine
areas and we practice bio security with them. This means that we wash hands, change shoes,
clothes, after interacting with new arrivals. The quarantine area is located away from other
goats New arrivals are observed and kept in quarantine for up to 2 to 4 weeks, depending on 
their origin.  We attempt to purchase new comers in pairs or more from the same herd so that
they will not be lonely.  

### Visitors

We ask that visitors wash hands or use hand sanitizer prior to and after interacting with our animals.
Please do not take it as an insult or that we think you are unsanitary we ask everyone this
including my own mother.  We have considered purchasing covers for shoes and disposable gloves.
