#Learn

We are compiling our notes and preparing to post all our knowledge on
goats (leaning toward Nigerian Dwarf/Pygmy) along with links to outside
resources. We believe that knowledge is power and have struggled over
the years to find indepth resources for the care of goats. 

It seems that most information comes from hearsay. Although there is a
lot of truths behind that hearsay there is also a lot of myths. A great
example of a myth is that goats eat tin cans. This is not true. It most
likely comes from an observation of a goat nibbling, to taste and see if
she likes it, a tin can.
