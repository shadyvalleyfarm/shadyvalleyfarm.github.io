# Basic Care

This advice is based on our experience with Nigerian Dwarf goats but should
be applicable to others. Every situation is different and you may need to
adapt the following to your own needs and your herd choices.

1 **Shelter**: Goats need shelter from the elements. They dislike
rain and will seek shelter on the first drop. Shelter should be able
to keep a goat dry and out of cold winds and out of direct sunlight.
If you search the internet you'll find many different typs of shelters
used. Which one is best for your herd depends on your climate, numbers in
your herd, personal preferences, and size of goats.  Three sided shelters
are common as is stalls in full enclosed barns. 

2 **Companionship**: Goats need companionship. The best companionship
being other goats. They need friends. Although other animals will work,
such as dogs, llamas, cattle, sheep, etc, they do best with other goats.
There is an old saying that a lonely goat is a dead goat. A lonely goat
will get depressed and the stress for that will make her more susceptible
to illness.

3 **Fresh Water**: Goats need fresh water no matter the time of year. They
tend to be picky and will not drink dirty water. Water that has been tainted
by feces or urine can lead to health issues.  If automatic waterers are used
they should be kept clean and tend to be forgotten about since they are
"automatic."

4 **Hoof Care**: Hooves need to be trimmed regularly. Untrimmed hooves can
lead to health issues.

5 **Minerals**: Goats need minerals in addition to their regular roughage. 
Be careful with minerals formulated for both goats and sheep as it will be
lacking in copper (which can be harmful to sheep) which goats need.

6 **Diet**: Goats need roughage. There are several commercial brands of feed
available some are better than others. If feed is provided in addition to
rougage it should be balanced out to provide any missing nutrients from the
daily browsing of the goat.

7 **Toys**: Although it may not seem needed goats need toys to play with. I'm
not talking about dog toys. I'm talking about things to climb on, explore, and
exercise their curiosity on.  Examples include rocks, tables, cable spools(turned
on the side), and even little tykes play sets for children.  Please be sure
to check any toys for safety including little parts your goats may try to sample
and choke on. 

8 **Vet Care**: Be sure to have a vet nearby who has experience with goats. Vets
who work with your dog or cat may not work with goats and vets who work with
your horse or cattle may not work with goats. 

There's a lot involved with goats but we think the joy of goats is worth all of it.
Spend some time researching the topic prior to purchasing to be sure goats are
a good fit for you.
