# Dairy Breeds

Although all breeds of goat produce milk, some are better than others. The following
list covers common dairy breeds and their benefits.

**Nigerian Dwarf:** This is our favorite breed for dairy. The milk from Nigerian Dwarf
goats is high in butter fat and in our opinion tastes great.  There are three registries
which recognize the Nigerian Dwarf and those are Nigerian Dwarf Goat Association (NDGA),
American Goat Society (AGS), and American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA).
