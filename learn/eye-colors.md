title: Eye Color Genetics
---

One of the most confusing topics for me is genetics. With a mission to improve
our breeds of goat genetics is important. This article attempts to break down
the basics of eye color genetics.  I'm not an expert but I did pay attention
in science classes and I've researched this a bit so I have confidence in the
accuracy, however, if you find an error please let us know.

Basic inheritance is dominant and recessive. Blue eyes is dominant and brown
is recessive. Which just means that blue eyes is the preferred trait. The following
table attemps to break it down.

In the following chart B (upper case B) represents blue eyes and b (lower case b)
represents brown eyes. This is how it is represented in genetics. A "BB" means that
both parents have blue eyes, a Bb means that one parent blue and one brown, bb means
both parents brown. Each single letter represents a parent and the combination of the
two parents is where the double letters come in. 

This chart shows the likelihood of eye color based on the genetics of the parent
|Parent 1|Parent2|Blue Eyed (BB)|Blue Eyed but with brown (Bb)|Brown Eyed (no blue) (bb)|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|BB|BB|100%|0%|0%|
|BB|Bb|50%|50%|0%|
|BB|bb|0%|100%|0%|
|bb|Bb|0%|50%|50%|
|bb|bb|0%|0%|100%|
|Bb|Bb|25%|50%|25%|
