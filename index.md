## Welcome

Welcome to the home page of Shady Valley Farm, LLC. Originally started in 2012 as a goat creamery from a love of
goats dating back to 1986. First goats where a Saanen back in 1986. Since then lots of happened and changed. In 2012
Nigerian Dwarf goats were chosen because of their higher butterfat and smaller nature. The creamery was a hobby project
while I worked a fulltime job to "pay the bills." The farm has grown from just a couple of does to now 21 goats.

*December 27, 2015* - Unfortunately, the job which is supposed to "pay the bills" while building the hobby into a business
has had a change and I am forced to relocate to an urban area. I have been faced with a very difficult decision. After much deliberation and considering of options
I have decided that the best option is to sell off the entire herd. I would like to sell them all as a complete package. I have
a few family units who have a strong bond and get along well with each other and I want to try to avoid stressing them.

The entire herd consists of 13 does, 3 bucks, and 5 wethers.  I was going to begin DHI and LA in 2016, however, this will not be
happening now. 

The following table lists the entire herd with individual asking prices. The entire herd may be purchased for $4500.00 as a whole.

This list is missing some data just because I am lazy and have not had a chance to dig through all my paperwork

Goats are dual ADGA and AGS registered/registerable (except wethers). Only ADGA information is listed below

## Entire Herd Package

The goats remaining without a deposit may be purchased together for $2000.00 or see the groups of 4 below or inquire about sales of 1 or 2 together.

## Select Groups

I'm grouping together smaller groups of goats. These groups are discounted.  I would consider swapping around some goats in these groups, however, the reason I'm selling is because
I can not keep them I will not put myself in a situation to end up with one or two goats who can't be sold. So please keep this in mind when inquiring. 

### Group 1 - $1100.00

This group includes 3 does and 1 buck. Fawn is the niece of Coco other than that they are unrelated.

|Number|ADGA_Registered_Name|Date_Of_birth|Gender

### Pregnacy 

All pregnant does are reserved.

# Individual Sales

I am beginning to accept requests for individual goats, however, I'll give preference to group purchses.  I won't sell a goat to live alone. Goats need companionship of other goats in order to be happy. There is
an old saying "A lonely goat is a dead goat."   Wethers make great pets and are better pets than does. Please consider this when asking about does as pets.  Multiple purchase discounts will be applied.

Please keep in mind that my goal is to sell the entire herd before the end of February. I have some individual goats who I get constant requests for and others with very little interest. If you're willing to take a low interest goat (such 
as a wether or older doe) I'll make a better deal than just the high demand goats.  I don't want to be stuck with one or two goats with no demand.

I have more in each goat than they are individually priced. I'm taking a huge loss on this herd but I need to move them soon. 

Some of the information on this site is a bit dated. Not all goats are listed under "Goats"  but the above table is up-to-date and accurate. I'll be updating pics and information on individual goat pages as time permits.

All goats are due for CD&T shots in March 2016. Hooves were trimmed in December 2015. I do random fecals to test for internal parasites. See below for more specifics.

# Additional Information

## Herd Health

This herd routinely receives fecal examinations. Both in house and randomly selected goat's fecals are tested by a veterinarian.  CAE and CL tests have been negative. A herd this size is costly to test the full herd annually for CAE and CL. Goats are tested when brought into the herd, they come from herds who also test negative, and randomly selected goats are tested throughout the year. 

All goats receive an annual CD&T vacination.   

Probiotics are provided regularly and the diet is varied in order to keep the flora in the goat's rumen familiar with a variety of foods.  Premium Chaffhaye hay is provided on a regular basis along with
dry alfalfa, roughage, and whatever they find when out browsing.  Grain is generally avoided however it is feed occassinally to keep the flora used to it and to help prevent bloat if ending up on a grain fed farm.

I have had my share of unexpected deaths and in all cases have had a necropsy performed to know the actual cause of death.  A lot of breeders will just say they have only had goats die from "bloat" which unfortunately is not a very good diagnosis since most dead goats will look bloated.  We have had goats die from various reasons including copper toxicosis (too much copper - never did find the source) and a sudden parasite outbreak. 

I'm happy to discuss any health concerns and provide test results.  Some tests have been performed by local veterinarian and others by the University of Missouri Veterinary Services Laboratory.
