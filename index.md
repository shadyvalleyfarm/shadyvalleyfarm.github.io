## Welcome

Welcome to our homestead on the web.

We are a small farm located outside of Fredericktown, MO.  We love
the beauty of freedom that Missouri has to offer.  We raise chickens
and goats on our little farm. We have pygmy and nigerian dwarf goats.
Our most recent additions are registered nigerian dwarfs and we will
be offering their offspring for sale in 2014.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to raise happy, healthy, friendly, and overall wonderful
goats. We aim to improve all breeds we raise through thoughtful breedings and
education of ourselves and others.
