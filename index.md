## Welcome

Welcome to the home page of Shady Valley Farm, LLC. Originally started in 2012 as a goat creamery from a love of
goats dating back to 1986. First goats where a Saanen back in 1986. Since then lots of happened and changed. In 2012
Nigerian Dwarf goats were chosen because of their higher butterfat and smaller nature. The creamery was a hobby project
while I worked a fulltime job to "pay the bills." The farm has grown from just a couple of does to now 21 goats.

*December 27, 2015* - Unfortunately, the job which is supposed to "pay the bills" while building the hobby into a business
has had a change and I am forced to relocate to an urban area. I have been faced with a very difficult decision. After much deliberation and considering of options
I have decided that the best option is to sell off the entire herd. I would like to sell them all as a complete package. I have
a few family units who have a strong bond and get along well with each other and I want to try to avoid stressing them.

The entire herd consists of 13 does, 3 bucks, and 5 wethers.  I was going to begin DHI and LA in 2016, however, this will not be
happening now. 

The following table lists the entire herd with individual asking prices. The entire herd may be purchased for $5000.00 as a whole.


This list is missing some data just because I am lazy and have not had a chance to dig through all my paperwork

Goats are dual ADGA and AGS registered (except wethers). Only ADGA information is listed below

I have more in each goat than they are individually priced. I'm taking a huge loss on this herd but I need to move them soon. 

The information on this site is a bit dated. Not all goats are listed under "Goats"  but the above table is up-to-date and accurate. I'll be updating pics and information on individual goat pages as time permits.

All goats are due for CD&T shots in March 2016. Hooves were trimmed in December 2016. I do random fecals to test for internal parasites.
