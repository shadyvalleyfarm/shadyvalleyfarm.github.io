### Description

Sweet Pea is a very appropriate name for this girl. She is calm and loves to
spend time with humans. She does tend to get a bit jealous but shows it in
a non aggressive way. She will gently nudge you to let you know she is near
and ready to be petted.  When she is not trying to eat up attention she will
play with the others. 

We plan to breed her soon and have high hopes for her kids.
