### Description

Shuana is another girl we proudly purchased from Red Horse Valley. I admit that my motivation for her wasn't purely for her
bloodline. While I was purchasing Hope and D'Arcy I observed Shauna in the distance. She caught my eye. She was behaving a lot
like my dog and was rolling around in the grass. There was something different about her and I knew I wanted her. I was turned
down at first but kept the interest open and I was given the opportunity to purchase her.  I'm very glad I did. She came with
another fine girl, [RHV CS Dust O'Gold](/goats/RHV_SCHR_Dust_O_Gold) who had just been weened from her mom. Shauna took Dusty
in and treated her as her own. She protected her from the other bigger girls and they were always together. I knew I had made a good
choice.

### Pedigree

I am experimenting with a pedigree widget. This is the first draft. You could call this "beta" 
especially since it does not do much at this time.
