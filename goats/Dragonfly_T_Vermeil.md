### Description

Mei (pronounced like May) is an exceptionally friendly and caring goat. She has earned the name of "Big Momma" and has had 4 or more in her births. Unfortunately 
after a fight with mastitis in 2013 she only has a half functioning udder. This means that only one teat provides milk. Her kids will need supplimental milk

She is one of my favorite goats. She just has a personality that will win you over. She is calm and laid back. She was also a great mother to her kids this past fall despite the udder trouble she had.
