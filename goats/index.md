<hr>

Our small, but growing herd is listed below. We will keep past and 
present goats listed here for reference. When possible we link to
the parents for pedigree purposes.

As of October 21, 2013 our entire herd is CAE, CL, and Johne's Disease
negative. We implement strict bio-security and quarantine procedures
for new comers to the herd. As such we plan to only test each animal
upon arrival.  We are also very particular about who we buy from.
