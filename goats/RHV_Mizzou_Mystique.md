### Description

Mizzou comes to us from Red Horse Valley and will be our sole herd sire for the next yearish. 
Mizzou's sire has an [interesting story](http://www.redhorsevalley.com/centos-story/) and I recommend reading
about him and the excellent work by the team at University of Missouri - Columbia Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Mizzou was
given his name because of this work. 

Mizzou has some strong family lines with good records. On top of that he has a great personality and I am looking forward
to seeing what he produces.

### Pedigree

I am experimenting with a pedigree widget. This is the first draft. You could call this "beta" 
especailly since it does not do much at this time.
