### Description

Mizzou comes to us from Red Horse Valley and will be our sole herd sire for the next yearish. 
Mizzou's sire has an [interesting story](http://www.redhorsevalley.com/centos-story/) and I recommend reading
about him and the excellent work by the team at University of Missouri - Columbia Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Mizzou was
given his name because of this work. 

Mizzou has some strong family lines with good records. On top of that he has a great personality and I am looking forward
to seeing what he produces.

In 2013 at the ADGA Spotlight Sale 2 of Mizzou's cousins sold for $2800 and $1800. In addition he is a related to
Rosasharn SH Epic \*B who in 2011 sold for $8700.
