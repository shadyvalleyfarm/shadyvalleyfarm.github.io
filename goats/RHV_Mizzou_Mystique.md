### Description

Mizzou comes to us from Red Horse Valley and will be our sole herd sire for the next yearish. 
Check out his pedigree below or the [ADGA Genetics Profile](http://www.adgagenetics.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D001630035)
to learn more. I will write a full bio of him soon. 

### Pedigree

I am experimenting with a pedigree widget. This is the first draft. You could call this "beta" 
especailly since it does not do much at this time.
