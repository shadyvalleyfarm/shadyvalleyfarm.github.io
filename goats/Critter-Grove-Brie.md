Brie was only 8 months old and during that very short 8 months she had become a very unique goat. She still liked to do goat things but marched to the beat of her own drum. She was under developed which was a concern and I removed her from the breeding program because of that. Instead it was decided that she'd be just a pet. This was perfect for her since she preferred being around humans more than other goats and had developed a diva attitude. She could give you a look that showed her attitude and when you called her name while she was busy she'd say "What?" (as close to sounding like what as a goat can get). Her colors changed over the months and she became a near solid chocolate goat at the end. 

Unfortunately for unknown reasons she died of copper toxicity.
