Brie is one of the newest additions to the herd. She comes from the same family
as Sweet Pea(Brie's Dam is Sweet Pea's grandmother) and we have already found 
personality similarities with the two.  Brie is slowly getting darker and more
brown in her coat than when she was born and is a very beautiful doe.
