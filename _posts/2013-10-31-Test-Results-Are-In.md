## The test results are in

**{{ page.date | date_to_string }}** - I decided to have the entire herd retested when Mizzou, Mei, and Amigo came
to live with us.  Fecal tests were good only a few minor problems which have
been addressed and today I got a call from my vet that they all tested
negative for CAE, CL, and Johne's Disease. 

The following where included in the tests

* [Dragonfly T Vermeil](/goats/Dragonfly_T_Vermeil)
* [Critter Grove Sweet Pea](/goats/Critter-Grove-Sweet-Pea)
* [Critter Grove Brie](/goats/Critter-Grove-Brie)
* [Shady Valley Sadie](/goats/Shady-Valley-Sadie)
* [Shady Valley Samantha](/goats/Shady-Valley-Samantha)
* [RHV Mizzou Mystique](/goats/RHV_Mizzou_Mystique)
* [(Critter Grove) Buddy](/goats/Buddy)
* [(RHV) Amigo](/goats/Amigo)

All new arrivals in the future will be tested before being placed with the herd.

I am waiting for the paper results from my vet. Once I have those I'll scan and
post online.

I would also like to point out that these were good herd level tests they are not
100% guarantees that every animal in my herd is negative.  CL, for example, is hard to test for
and get accurate results. There are multiple types of tests. One of which is
to culture the abscess. My herd doesn't have any abscesses to test (which I
take as a good thing). We tested via blood which checks for antibodies.
The lack of antibodies indicate that the animals haven't been exposed but not a 
guarantee. This is just one example of some of the draw backs to testing but it
is the best we can use right now. 

Although these tests are expensive I will continually have the herd tested until
it is closed off from new arrivals, full bio-security is implemented, and
there have been multiple years of negative tests.  I do take a lot of precautions
with my herd and I try to ascertain the health of the goat before I purchase and
use quarantine procedures.  I also try to buy from reputable breeders.

The topic of herd health, quarantine, diseases, virus, and
other bio-security related issues are way too complicated for this post. I
do plan to cover them in more detail later.
 
I would like to thank [Red Horse Valley](http://redhorsevalley.com) and 
[Critter Grove Ranch](http://www.crittergroveranch.com/) for providing the
healthy goats we have and taking good care of their herd.

If you don't know a lot about CAE, CL, and Johne's Disease I figured I'd
include some links below

* [Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis(CAE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprine_Arthritis_Encephalitis)
* [Caseous Lymphadenitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caseous_lymphadenitis)
* [Paratuburculosis/Johne's Disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratuberculosis)

Here's more information on CL from Washington State University [http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts_waddl/FAQ/cl.aspx](Caseous Lymphodenitis
