## The test results are in

**{{ page.date | date_to_string }}** - I decided to have the entire herd retested when Mizzou, Mei, and Amigo come
to live with us.  Fecal tests were good only a few minor problems which have
been addressed and today I got a call from my vet that they all tested
negative for CAE, CL, and Johne's Disease. 

The following where included in the tests

* [Dragonfly T Vermeil](/goats/Dragonfly_T_Vermeil)
* [Critter Grove Sweet Pea](/goats/Critter-Grove-Sweet-Pea)
* [Critter Grove Brie](/goats/Critter-Grove-Brie)
* [Shady Valley Sadie](/goats/Shady-Valley-Sadie)
* [Shady Valley Samantha](/goats/Shady-Valley-Samantha)
* [RHV Mizzou Mystique](/goats/RHV_Mizzou_Mystique)
* [(Critter Grove)Buddy](/goats/Buddy)
* (RHV)Amigo

All new arrivals in the future will be tested before being placed with the herd.

I realize that those can be a bit controversial among goat people. Since my
herd is my retirement plan and I get great amount of enjoyment out of them
I prefer to test and be sure that they are all healthy.  In a future post
I will cover the bio-security and quarantine procedures we have here.

I would like to thank [Red Horse Valley](http://redhorsevalley.com) and 
[Critter Grove Ranch](http://www.crittergroveranch.com/) for providing the
healthy goats we have and taking good care of their herd.

If you don't know a lot about CAE, CL, and Johne's Disease I figured I'd
include some links below
