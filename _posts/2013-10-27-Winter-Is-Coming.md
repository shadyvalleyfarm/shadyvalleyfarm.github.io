## Winter Is Coming

As Winter approaches we've been busy getting the farm ready. At the same
time I've been dedicating time to our online presence. I've decided to put
a blog up on the site to share thoughts, ideas, announcements, and events.

I'm hoping this blog can be an useful resource for all. 

On the what's new front we've recently acquired a new doe and buck(and companion
wether for him).  They have settled in great and are demonstrating excellent
personalities.  I'll get information and pics of them posted soon.

I've also created a Facebook page for the Farm. It'll probably have more quick
updates and pics than this site so you can "like" the page and stay updated
on news around the farm.  Like us at [https://www.facebook.com/shadyvalleyfarm](https://www.facebook.com/shadyvalleyfarm)
